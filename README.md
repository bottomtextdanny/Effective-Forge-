Effective mod written for Forge, originally developed by doctor4t for the Fabric mod loader

This fork updates the mod to Minecraft 1.20.1 and adds support for Rubidium.

Without permission from creators of the original Effective mod and the Effective (Forge) mod, I will not be releasing any public builds of this mod, nor will any requests be entertained.
